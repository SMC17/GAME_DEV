# TURMOIL - Milestone 1 Report

## Project Overview

TURMOIL is an ambitious oil industry simulation game that combines strategic management, narrative-driven gameplay, and dynamic economic systems. The game aims to provide players with a comprehensive experience of building and managing an oil company, from small-scale drilling operations to global energy empire.

## Completed Components

### Core Engine
- Implemented the core oil field simulation module `oil_field.zig`
- Developed the main simulation engine `simulation.zig` with:
  - Oil extraction mechanics
  - Basic economy (money and oil prices)
  - Field management

### Game Modes
- **Core Simulation**: Basic simulation demo showing oil extraction, field management, and economic indicators
- **Campaign Mode**: Started implementation with:
  - Mission system with objectives and progression
  - Narrative elements with story events and dialogue
  - Basic company management
- **Arcade Mode**: Fast-paced, score-based mode with:
  - Multiple difficulty levels
  - Combo mechanics for scoring
  - Time-based challenges
  - High score system

### UI System
- Implemented a basic terminal UI system with:
  - Color and text styling
  - Menu rendering
  - Status bars and horizontal lines
  - Banners and titles

### Game Launcher
- Created a central launcher that connects all game modes
- Implemented navigation between different modes
- Added descriptive text for each mode

## Next Steps (Milestone 2)

### Engine Enhancements
- Add more realistic oil field behaviors (depletion rates, discovery mechanics)
- Implement advanced economic simulation (market trends, competition)
- Add resource constraints and supply chains

### Game Mode Expansion
- **Campaign Mode**:
  - More missions with increasing complexity
  - Enhanced narrative system with branching storylines
  - More detailed company management
- **Arcade Mode**:
  - Special events and challenges
  - Power-ups and special abilities
  - Leaderboards
- **Tycoon/GM Mode**:
  - Implement detailed economic simulation
  - Add competition with AI-controlled companies
  - Strategic decision-making mechanics
- **Character-Building Mode**:
  - Skill trees and progression systems
  - Character-specific storylines
  - Personality traits affecting gameplay

### Graphics & UI
- Begin transitioning from terminal UI to a graphical interface
- Design and implement basic sprites and animations
- Create a more intuitive and visually appealing interface

### Technical Improvements
- Refactor project structure for better modularity
- Add more comprehensive test suite
- Implement save/load functionality

## Timeline

- **Weeks 5-8**: Complete implementation of campaign mode and begin tycoon mode
- **Weeks 9-12**: Complete arcade mode enhancements and tycoon mode
- **Weeks 13-16**: Implement character mode and begin sandbox mode
- **Weeks 17-20**: Integration, polishing, and final testing

## Conclusion

Milestone 1 has established the foundational architecture of TURMOIL, implementing the core simulation engine and the basic structure of multiple game modes. The game is now in a playable state with working campaign and arcade modes, albeit with limited features. The next phase will focus on deepening the gameplay experience, expanding the available modes, and enhancing the overall user experience.

We are currently on track with the original 20-week development timeline and have made significant progress in establishing the core systems that will drive the full game experience.
