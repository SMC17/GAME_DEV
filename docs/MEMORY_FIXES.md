# Memory Management Fixes

This document summarizes all the memory-related fixes implemented in the TURMOIL project.

## Summary of Issues

The project had several memory management issues:

1. Memory leaks in the sandbox mode (oil fields not properly freed)
2. Missing allocator arguments in several `allocPrint` calls
3. Unicode character usage causing compatibility issues
4. Error handling for player data saving operations
5. Benchmark memory leaks

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. SandboxMode Oil Field Memory Management

- Updated the `deinit` function in `SandboxMode` to properly free each oil field by calling `field.deinit(self.allocator)` for each field in `oil_fields`.
- Ensured that `custom_name` and `custom_notes` are properly freed in the `SandboxOilField.deinit` method.

```zig
pub fn deinit(self: *SandboxMode) void {
    for (self.oil_fields.items) |*field| {
        field.deinit(self.allocator);
    }
    self.oil_fields.deinit();
    self.simulation.deinit();
    self.disaster_history.deinit();
    self.price_history.deinit();
}
```

### 2. Fixed Missing Arguments in allocPrint Calls

- Added missing argument parameter to `allocPrint` calls in `sandbox_runner.zig`:

```zig
try ui.print(try std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, "   Weather Patterns: ", .{}), .cyan, .italic);
```

### 3. Replaced Unicode Characters with ASCII

- Replaced Unicode bullet point character `â€¢` with ASCII asterisk `*` in `terminal_ui.zig`:

```zig
grid.items[y].items[x] = '*';
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- Added proper error handling for `saveGlobalPlayerData` calls in `sandbox_mode.zig`, using try/catch blocks to log warnings if saving fails:

```zig
saveGlobalPlayerData(global_player) catch |err| {
    std.debug.print("Warning: Could not save player data: {any}\n", .{err});
};
```

### 5. Added Cleanup Cost Multiplier

- Added missing `cleanup_cost_multiplier` field in `sandbox_mode.zig`:

```zig
.cleanup_cost_multiplier = 1.0,
```

## Testing the Fixes

All memory issues have been verified fixed through:

1. Building and running with `zig build run`
2. Running tests with `zig build test`
3. Running benchmarks with `zig build benchmark`

The memory leak issues in the benchmarks are now resolved, with no memory leak errors reported.

## Best Practices Added

We've also added documentation about memory management best practices:

1. Created a memory management section in `docs/testing.md`
2. Added contributing guidelines in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
3. Updated the changelog to reflect memory management fixes

## Future Considerations

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Consider implementing memory leak detection tools in CI/CD
2. Add checks for proper allocator usage
3. Create code review templates focusing on memory management
4. Consider implementing a static analysis tool for Zig
