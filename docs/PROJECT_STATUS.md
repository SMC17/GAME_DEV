2. Enhance AI competitor strategies in Tycoon Mode
3. Integrate Character Mode skills with Campaign Mode missions
4. Implement saving/loading functionality across all modes
5. Add more visual elements to the terminal UI

### Medium-term Goals (3-4 Weeks)
1. Add environmental impact simulation to all game modes
2. Implement geopolitical events that affect oil markets
3. Create more dynamic narrative branches in Campaign Mode
4. Develop a more comprehensive character progression system
5. Add procedurally generated scenarios for Sandbox Mode

### Long-term Goals (2+ Months)
1. Explore graphical UI options beyond terminal-based interface
2. Implement multiplayer features for competitive/cooperative gameplay
3. Create a modding system for user-generated content
4. Develop mobile platform compatibility
5. Add localization support for multiple languages

## Current Limitations and Known Issues
- The menu navigation system doesn't fully support keyboard input in all modes
- Some placeholder features in Campaign Mode (oil field management)
- Character Mode skills don't yet fully integrate with other game modes
- Limited random events and world-building elements
- No save/load functionality implemented yet

## Conclusion

The TURMOIL project has established a solid foundation with multiple playable game modes, each with unique mechanics and gameplay loops. The focus on memory management and error handling has improved code quality and stability. The next phase of development should focus on feature completion, cross-mode integration, and user experience enhancements.
