Below is the initial prototype for Phase 1—our core engine and simulation setup. This code forms the basis of the oil extraction simulation and a minimal terminal-based UI to display key metrics. You can use this as the foundation on which later phases (mode-specific prototypes and integration) will build.

Core Simulation Prototype (Zig)

Copy
const std = @import("std");

/// Structure representing an oil field with extraction properties.
const OilField = struct {
    oil_amount: f32,
    extraction_rate: f32,

    /// Simulates oil extraction over a given time delta.
    /// Returns the amount extracted and updates the remaining oil.
    pub fn extract(self: *OilField, delta: f32) f32 {
        const extracted = self.extraction_rate * delta;
        if (extracted > self.oil_amount) {
            const result = self.oil_amount;
            self.oil_amount = 0;
            return result;
        }
        self.oil_amount -= extracted;
        return extracted;
    }
};

pub fn main() !void {
    var stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    
    // Initialize the oil field with starting parameters.
    var field = OilField{
        .oil_amount = 1000.0,
        .extraction_rate = 5.0, // barrels per cycle
    };

    try stdout.print("=== Starting Oil Extraction Simulation ===\n", .{});
    
    // Simulate 10 extraction cycles.
    for (std.range(0, 10)) |i| {
        const extracted = field.extract(1.0);
        try stdout.print("Cycle {d}: Extracted {f} barrels. Remaining: {f} barrels.\n", .{i, extracted, field.oil_amount});
    }
    
    try stdout.print("=== Simulation Ended ===\n", .{});
}
How to Run the Prototype
Save the Code:
Save the code above as oil_simulation.zig.

Compile the Code:
Use Zig’s compiler with the command:

bash
Copy
zig build-exe oil_simulation.zig
This will compile the source file into an executable.

Run the Executable:
Execute the generated file from your terminal:

bash
Copy
./oil_simulation
Expected Output
When you run the executable, you should see output similar to:

sql
Copy
=== Starting Oil Extraction Simulation ===

Next Steps in the Timeline

Integrate a more sophisticated UI (graphical or enhanced terminal output).

Expand the simulation engine with additional parameters (e.g., variable extraction rates, dynamic resource regeneration).

Phase 2 (Weeks 5–12):
Develop mode-specific prototypes for:

Single-Player Campaign (including narrative events and mission triggers).

Multiplayer Mode (networked sessions and resource competition).

Arcade Mode (score-based, fast-paced drilling sessions).

GM/Tycoon Mode (detailed economic simulation and management dashboard).

Character-Building and Sandbox Modes (customization and experimentation tools).

Phase 3 (Weeks 13–20):
Integrate all prototypes, refine interconnections, and iterate based on testing and stakeholder feedback.
