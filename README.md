# TURMOIL

## Oil Industry Simulator Game

TURMOIL is an ambitious oil industry simulation game that combines strategic management, narrative-driven gameplay, and dynamic economic systems. The game aims to provide players with a comprehensive experience of building and managing an oil company, from small-scale drilling operations to global energy empire.

## Game Modes

- **Single-Player Campaign**: Experience a narrative journey from modest beginnings to oil industry dominance with mission objectives, character relationships, and story events
- **Arcade Mode**: Fast-paced, score-based drilling challenges with combo mechanics and high scores
- **Tycoon Mode**: Comprehensive economic simulation with market dynamics, AI competitors, random world events, and corporate management
- **Character Mode**: Develop unique characters with specialized skills, traits, backgrounds, and complete quests to progress
- **Sandbox Mode**: Experiment with all game systems in an open-ended environment with customizable parameters

## Development Status

The game is currently in active development, following a 20-week roadmap:

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: âœ… Core Engine & Simulation Setup
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12)**: ðŸ”„ Mode-Specific Module Prototypes (75% complete)
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 13-20)**: ðŸ“… Integration & Iteration (Planning)

See our [Project Status Report](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) for detailed information on current progress and next steps.
