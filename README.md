## Oil Industry Simulator Game

TURMOIL is an ambitious oil industry simulation game that combines strategic management, narrative-driven gameplay, and dynamic economic systems. The game aims to provide players with a comprehensive experience of building and managing an oil company, from small-scale drilling operations to global energy empire.

## Game Modes

- **Single-Player Campaign**: Experience a narrative journey from modest beginnings to oil industry dominance
- **Arcade Mode**: Fast-paced, score-based drilling challenges
- **GM/Tycoon Mode**: Deep economic simulation with market dynamics and corporate management (Coming Soon)
- **Character-Building Mode**: Develop unique characters with specialized skills and personal storylines (Coming Soon)
- **Free-Play/Sandbox Mode**: Experiment with all game systems in an open-ended environment (Coming Soon)

## Development Status

The game is currently in early prototype stage, following a 20-week development roadmap:

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: âœ… Core Engine & Simulation Setup
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12)**: ðŸ”„ Mode-Specific Module Prototypes
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 13-20)**: ðŸ“… Integration & Iteration

## Current Features

- Core oil extraction simulation with economic elements
- Campaign mode with mission objectives and narrative events
- Arcade mode with time-based challenges and scoring system
- Terminal-based UI with colorful menus and status displays
- Central game launcher to access all modes
