- **User Interface:**  
  • Design screens for customization, skill allocation, and character status tracking.

### Free-Play/Sandbox Mode
- **Open-Ended Simulation:**  
  • Develop tools for adjusting simulation parameters (oil field size, economic conditions, etc.).  
  • Enable dynamic world generation or scenario selections.  
- **Experimentation Tools:**  
  • Build simple editors or cheat tools for on-the-fly adjustments.  
  • Provide visual feedback to help players understand the impact of their changes.
- **Interconnectivity:**  
  • Allow progress or unlocks from other modes to be tested in a sandbox environment.

## 2. Refined Narrative and Art Direction

### Narrative Refinement
- **Core Story:**  
  • **Theme:** The rise of a modest oil company transforming into an industrial empire amid global challenges.  
  • **Setting:** A world where oil is both an economic catalyst and a geopolitical pawn, marked by environmental and social consequences.
- **Key Elements:**  
  • **Characters:** Define roles such as the visionary CEO, rugged wildcatters, cunning rivals, and influential political figures.  
  • **Lore:** Develop a backstory that details the evolution of the oil industry in this universe, including historical events and technological breakthroughs.  
  • **Story Arcs:**  
    - **Campaign Missions:** Focus on personal ambition, corporate intrigue, and the struggle against market forces.  
    - **Side Quests:** Offer insights into local communities, environmental impacts, and individual heroics.
- **Tone & Style:**  
  • Blend gritty realism with stylized dramatics—serious economic and strategic challenges interspersed with moments of high-energy, arcade-style action.

### Art Direction Refinement
- **Visual Style:**  
  • **Overall Aesthetic:** A fusion of realistic industrial environments with artistic exaggeration for key gameplay moments (e.g., dramatic oil well lighting, vibrant explosions of progress).  
  • **Character Design:** Characters should have distinct silhouettes and attire that visually narrate their roles (e.g., rugged, utilitarian looks for wildcatters versus sleek, modern designs for corporate executives).
- **Color Palette & Mood:**  
  • Use earthy, muted tones for backgrounds, accented with vibrant hues during key actions or UI highlights.  
  • Establish mood boards that balance the raw industrial feel with moments of dynamic action.
- **UI/UX Elements:**  
  • Develop concept sketches for dashboards, mission screens, and HUDs that are clean, responsive, and contextually thematic.  
  • Ensure visual consistency across modes while allowing subtle stylistic tweaks suited to each gameplay experience.

## 3. Initial Prototyping Roadmap

### Prototyping Framework and Phases

#### **Phase 1: Core Engine and Simulation Setup**
- **Objective:** Validate the basic oil extraction and resource management systems.
- **Tasks:**
  • Build a lightweight simulation engine in Zig to handle core loops (oil discovery, extraction, resource depletion).  
  • Implement a basic UI framework to display simulation metrics.
- **Prototype Example (Zig – Pseudocode):**

  ```zig
  const std = @import("std");

  // Structure representing an oil field.
  const OilField = struct {
      oil_amount: f32,
      extraction_rate: f32,

      // Function to simulate oil extraction per cycle.
      pub fn extract(self: *OilField, delta: f32) f32 {
          const extracted = self.extraction_rate * delta;
          if (extracted > self.oil_amount) {
              const result = self.oil_amount;
              self.oil_amount = 0;
              return result;
          }
          self.oil_amount -= extracted;
          return extracted;
      }
  };

  pub fn main() void {
      var field = OilField{
          .oil_amount = 1000.0,
          .extraction_rate = 5.0,
      };

      var stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
      // Simulate 10 extraction cycles.
      for (std.range(0, 10)) |i| {
          const extracted = field.extract(1.0);
          _ = stdout.print("Cycle {d}: Extracted {f} barrels. Remaining: {f}\n", .{i, extracted, field.oil_amount});
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Phase 2: Mode-Specific Module Prototypes**
- **Single-Player Campaign:**  
  • Prototype a simple level with scripted narrative events and mission triggers.  
  • Integrate placeholder assets for dialogues and UI elements.
- **Multiplayer:**  
  • Develop a minimal networked session with two players sharing an oil field environment.  
  • Focus on basic resource competition and communication.
- **Arcade Mode:**  
  • Create a rapid drilling session with score tracking and escalating difficulty.  
  • Include immediate visual feedback and a countdown timer.
- **GM/Tycoon Mode:**  
  • Build a management dashboard displaying resource flow, market trends, and basic upgrade paths.  
  • Prototype economic simulation interactions.
- **Character-Building Mode:**  
  • Design a character creation screen with selectable traits and preview options.  
  • Implement a rudimentary skill tree for progression.
- **Sandbox Mode:**  
  • Develop a configurable simulation where parameters such as oil field size or economic variables can be adjusted live.  
  • Provide immediate feedback to showcase simulation variability.

#### **Phase 3: Integration and Iteration**
- **Interconnectivity:**  
  • Enable shared unlocks or progression benefits between modes (e.g., achievements in Arcade Mode influence GM/Tycoon Mode upgrades).  
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  • Conduct internal testing sessions to evaluate gameplay mechanics, UI responsiveness, and narrative flow.  
  • Iterate on designs based on feedback, refining mechanics, visuals, and story elements.
- **Documentation:**  
  • Maintain detailed records of design decisions, iteration notes, and prototype performance for ongoing reference.
